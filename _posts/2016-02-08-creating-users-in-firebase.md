This is the first of several tutorials meant to get you started with Firebase authentication and AngularJS. To get the full series, make sure you subscribe to the blog by entering your email at the end of this post.

Firebase is most well-known for being a very easy-to-use real-time database, but it's also really great for authentication too.

In this video tutorial, I'll show you how to start building an authentication system using AngularJS and Firebase in just a few lines of code.

When you combine authentication and data from Firebase with Angular, you get a really powerful toolset that allows you to build rich data-driven web applications without any server code at all.

You can find a working demo with all the code here:

Switch out my Firebase URL and try creating a few users on your own!
