If you don't know how to use the debugger, drop everything you're doing and watch these videos now. This is required 
viewing and you can thank me later.

From the hundreds of individual conversations I've had with new programmers, a shockingly small number have even been 
exposed to any sort of debugging tool. Most do not even know what debugger is. This was especially hard to understand, 
given that many had completed very long and difficult courses on JavaScript. The reason for this is very simple. Almost 
no beginning programming resources explain how to use it. This post is my attempt to help the situation.
