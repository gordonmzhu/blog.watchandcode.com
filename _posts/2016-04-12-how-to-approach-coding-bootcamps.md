*I get asked about coding bootcamps a lot. Here's a response I wrote to one of my students.*

I recommend first learning on your own and completely forgetting about bootcamps. Set a time limit, say two months for example, and during that time, evaluate your progress every two weeks. Also, during this time, do NOT explicitly prepare for the bootcamp interviews, actually try to learn practical skills. This is important because the things you need to study for bootcamp interviews are not very useful for real-life programming (e.g. Eloquent JavaScript, CoderByte). They are also really dull and will make you not like programming. I think some of the recommended resources to prepare for bootcamp interviews are actually toxic and have the unintended consequence of turning people away from programming altogether. This is a tragedy.

If you're building applications similar to what bootcamp students are doing after your two months, you just saved yourself $15-20K. If you're not making enough progress for whatever reason after your self-imposed time limit, maybe a bootcamp would help. 

The advantage here is that even if you don't make it on your own, the work you put in will help you nail the bootcamp interviews so that you don't waste your money on a second tier bootcamp. This is important because there is a very large variance in bootcamp quality and outcomes. 

Second, having spent time learning web development, you'll have a better idea if you'll actually like it (whereas if you just prepared for the interviews, you'd get a very skewed and boring view of the industry). 

Third, this initial learning time will also make you much more advanced than your bootcamp peers. That means you'll be at the top of your class and will be able to get more out of the bootcamp. It also means you'll have an easier time getting jobs than everyone else.

If you do end up applying to bootcamps, apply to App Academy as your first choice. They take a portion of your first year's salary rather than an upfront fee, which is a good thing. You want their payoff to be bigger if you get paid more. Similarly, if you fail to get a job, you want them to feel your pain too. If you don't get into App Academy, take a look at Hack Reactor and then Dev Bootcamp / Maker Square.

Customize this for your situation by varying the time limit of your self-learning period.
