This video was inspired by a
<a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/622915286782513152" target="_blank">
tweet</a> Sam Altman wrote last year. 

Sam's tweet caught my attention because it wasn't obvious to me that 
Hacker News had any JavaScript at all. So of course, I wanted to figure 
out what it did and how it worked. I thought it would be weird and 
complicated, but it turned out to be quite the opposite. You'll have to 
watch the video to see what I mean.

This was also inspired by my students â€” I just had a hunch that it 
would be a really cool example because a lot of them are startup people 
and Hacker News readers. 

I spend a lot of time looking for and writing realistic code examples 
because I know it makes a huge difference for my students. As a kid, it 
was hard for me to stay motivated because the subjects I was learning 
didn't seem very useful. Using unrealistic code (like most tutorials do 
today) creates the same problem that turned me away from school all 
those years ago.

As you're watching, make sure to stay tuned till the end of the video 
because there's a very special offer that lasts through the end of this 
month (March 2016). I got the idea for the offer from one of my 
favorite Paul Graham essays,

Do Things that Don't Scale</a>. I'm guessing many of you have already 
read it. If not, set aside a few minutes to read it today.
