I just posted the first four videos to a new course I'm working on. It's called Firebase Foundations. You can find the
course and read more about it here:

<a href="http://blog.watchandcode.com/firebase-foundations/">http://blog.watchandcode.com/firebase-foundations/</a>

A lot of my Angular students loved using Firebase as they went through <a href="https://watchandcode.com/courses/angular-course/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=watchandcodeblog&utm_campaign=blog">The Angular Course</a>, 
so I thought it would be cool to extract just the Firebase content out into its own course so that more people can 
experience what it's like to use Firebase with AngularJS.

This course is intended for people that have at least some familiarity with Angular and want to take advantage of
Firebase's authentication, database, security, and hosting features.

For existing <a href="https://watchandcode.com/courses/angular-course/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=watchandcodeblog&utm_campaign=blog">The Angular Course</a>
students, there's no need to do this course unless you want a quick refresher on Firebase. In Angular Course you 
actually go a lot deeper since you see how Firebase works in the context of a larger app, whereas the code demos in 
this course are solely focused on teaching you specific Firebase features and patterns.
